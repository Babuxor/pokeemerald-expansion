# pokeemerald Expansion Base

## What is the pokeemerald Expansion Base?

This base aims to combine some of the features I'd like to my pokeemerald base to have for easy access and use.
You are currently on the master branch which should always be a working (at least compileable version of the base)

## What feature branches are included?

- **[RHH's Battle Engine Upgrade](../tree/battle_engine):** Upgrades the battle engine in pokeemerald to newer Generation games' standards. It also adds newer moves and abilities.
- **[RHH's Pokémon Expansion](../tree/pokemon_expansion):** Adds Pokémon from newer Generations and makes them available in the National Dex. It also updates base stats and other Pokémon info.
- **[RHH's Item Expansion](../tree/item_expansion):** Adds items from newer Generations and also updates item effects for field use.
- **[TheXaman's PokedexPlus with a HGSS style](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=441996):** 
- **[ghoulslash's DexNav & Detector Mode](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=440571):**
- **[Some of ghoulslash's free_saveblock](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?p=10168472#post10168472):** Namely FREE_UNION_ROOM_CHAT, FREE_LINK_BATTLE_RECORDS, FREE_RECORD_MIXING_HALL_RECORDS and APPRENTICE_COUNT set to 1 instead of 4 as well as MAIL_COUNT set to (PARTY_SIZE) instead of (10 + PARTY_SIZE)
